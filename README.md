This is a matrix library. It is designed from scratch and it works(don't 
take my word for it look at the tests and demos what is working).
General computations with matrix are available inverting, solving linear 
systems, multiplying, transposing and much more. It was created as a 
necessity for solving homework, but a lot of effort is put in it. It can 
be seen as a demo of design patterns but also used for matrix 
calculations.
