This is a matrix library.It is designed from scratch and it works(Don't 
take my word for it look at the tests and demos ).
General computations with matrix are available inverting, solving linear 
systems, multiplying, transposing and much more. It was created as a 
necessity for solving homework but it was designed really well. It can 
be seen as a demo of desingn patterns but also used for matrix 
calculations.
